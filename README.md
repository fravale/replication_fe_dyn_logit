"Advances in maximum likelihood estimation of fixed-effects binary panel data models" 
Francesco Valentini, Claudia Pigini, and Francesco Bartolucci, (forthcoming).

Supplemtary material: the R code is split in two folders.

1) simulations/ simula_HK.R <-- reproduces the simulation design Honoré and Kyriazidou (2000) and the relative estimation results (Tabs 1-3,5-12); \\
                HK-1.R      <-- performs the Honoré and Kyriazidou (2000) estimator for the DL model with 1 continuous explanatory variable; \\
		dj.R        <-- performs the half-panl jackknife proposed by Dhaene and Jochmans (2015). \\
